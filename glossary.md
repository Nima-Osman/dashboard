| **Date of Specimen**        | Date the specimen was taken from the patient.                                                                                                                     |
| **Date Booked In**          | Date the specimen was booked into the lab’s LIMS system (Winpath). This can differ from the day the specimen was received due to lab backlogs and transportation delays. |
| **Today’s Date & Time**     | The day the data was pulled from Winpath.                                                                                                                         |
| **Sub-Speciality**          | The sub-speciality group of the specimen, which specifies the anatomical biopsy location (e.g., upper or lower GI tract) and distinguishes biopsies from large specimens. |
| **Specimen Type**           | Categorized into 7 types based on required stains and the number of levels to be cut, which define the specimen type.                                              |
| **Date of Status**          | The day the specimen was sent out of the laboratory, either to the pathologist or placed in a pooled tray.                                                         |
| **Lab Number**              | The patient’s unique ID number, ensuring confidentiality as the specimen moves through the laboratory.                                                             |
| **Total Time/Time Outstanding** | The total time elapsed from when the specimen was taken to when the data was pulled from Winpath, before authorization by the pathologist.                               |
| **Specimen-Booked**         | The time between when the specimen was taken and when it was booked into Winpath.                                                                                 |
| **Time in Lab**             | The time elapsed from when the specimen is booked into the lab to when it is sent out of the laboratory.                                                          |
| **Pathologist/Pooled**      | The time the specimen spent with the pathologist or in the pooled tray before the data was pulled from Winpath (only non-authorized cases were included).           |
